# bg_remover
## Current state
Current version removes background using U2Net library and rough thresholding.
Still to do:

- improve thresholding, using algorithms

- create an API version using FastAPI

- add background customization

- add user friendly input

---

Note: The first Docker build may take several minutes as it downloads and installs large dependencies (e.g., PyTorch). Subsequent builds will be much faster.
